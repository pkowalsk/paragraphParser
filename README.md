## Practicum

Take a paragraph of text and return an alphabetized list of unique words. A unique word is any form of a word often communicated with essentially the same meaning. For example, dish and dishes could be defined as a unique word by using their stem dish. For each unique word found in this entire paragraph, determine the how many times the word appears in total. Also, provide an analysis of what sentence index position or positions the word is found. The following words should not be included in your analysis or result set: "a", "the", "and", "of", "in", "be", "also" and "as". Return the result in JSON format.
